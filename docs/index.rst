.. _introduction:

A Python package for the fast calculation of Multi-unit Van Rossum
neural spike train metrics, with the kernel-based algorithm described
in Houghton and Kreuz, *On the efficient calculation of Van Rossum
distances* (Network: Computation in Neural Systems, 2012, 23,
48-58). This package started out as a Python wrapping of the original
C++ implementation given by the authors of the paper, and evolved from
there with bugfixes and improvements.
