# pymuvr
Multi-unit Van Rossum spike train metric. This is a kernel-based
implementation with markage vector and precomputed exponential factor,
as described in Houghton and Kreuz, 2012, 'On the efficient
calculation of Van Rossum distances.'. This package provides a Python
wrapping of the original C++ implementation given by the authors of
the paper.
